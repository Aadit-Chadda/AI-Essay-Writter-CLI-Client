1. Latex condoms: These are the most common type of condom and are made from latex rubber. They are inexpensive, easy to find, and highly effective at preventing pregnancy and some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) when used correctly.

2. Polyisoprene condoms: These condoms are made from a synthetic form of latex and offer many of the same benefits as latex condoms. They are thinner than latex condoms, making them more comfortable to wear.

3. Lambskin condoms: These condoms are made from the intestinal membrane of a lamb and are highly effective at preventing pregnancy. However, they may not offer protection against certain STIs, including HIV.

4. Polyurethane condoms: These condoms are made from a synthetic plastic and are usually thinner than latex and polyisoprene condoms. They are effective at preventing pregnancy and may offer some protection against certain STIs.

5. Novelty condoms: These are usually made from a variety of materials, including latex, lambskin, and polyurethane. They are not designed for contraception or STI prevention and may not be as effective as other types of condoms.
