1. Latex condoms: These are the most common type of condom and are made from latex rubber. They are inexpensive, easy to find, and highly effective at preventing pregnancy and some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) when used correctly.

2. Polyisoprene condoms: These condoms are made from a synthetic form of latex and offer many of the same benefits as latex condoms. They are thinner than latex condoms, making them more comfortable to wear.
