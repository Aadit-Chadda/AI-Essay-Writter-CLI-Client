para1 = "Weather simulations are extremely demanding for computational resources because they must process large amounts of data in order to accurately simulate the atmosphere. To do this, weather simulations can require hundreds of gigabytes of data, billions of calculations per second, and thousands of processors. For example, a simulation of the atmosphere for a single hour can require up to 500 gigabytes of data, billions of calculations per second, and over 10,000 processors. Furthermore, large-scale simulations of the atmosphere, such as those used in climate modeling, can require thousands of terabytes of data and millions of processors."
